SnakeApplesken

My own take of the classic Snake! game I played back in the day on Nokia 3310 and Sony Ericsson W810i.
Enjoy the nostalgia induced experience!!!

Windows 8.1 x86_64, MSVS 2017, Python 3.6.6, PyGame

comes with an executable too for funzies.
Made with CXFreeze and Inno Setup.

The image graphics I sketched myself primarily with GIMP free image software.
