I had to do my own take of the classic Snake game I played back in the day on Nokia 3310 and Sony Ericsson W810i.
Enjoy the nostalgia induced experience.

I hereby give you my notes. If you want some implementation help on how I went about to do this:</br>

Comes with an executable which you can install too for funzies.</br>
Made with CXFreeze and Inno Setup.
